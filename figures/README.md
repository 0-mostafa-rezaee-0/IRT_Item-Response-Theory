<h1 align="center">Figures Directory</h1>

This directory contains all visualizations and figures generated by the IRT (Item Response Theory) analysis code.

## Generated Visualizations

### 1. Item Characteristic Curves
- **File**: `item_characteristic_curves.png`
- **Description**: Shows the relationship between item difficulty and probability of correct response
- **Generated by**: IRT analysis scripts
- **Purpose**: Visualize how item parameters affect response probabilities

### 2. Adaptive Testing Convergence
- **File**: `adaptive_testing_convergence.png`
- **Description**: Demonstrates how adaptive testing algorithms converge to accurate ability estimates
- **Generated by**: Adaptive testing simulation scripts
- **Purpose**: Show the efficiency and accuracy of adaptive testing methods

## Usage

These figures are automatically generated when running the IRT analysis scripts. They serve as:

1. **Output artifacts** from computational analysis
2. **Visual documentation** of IRT concepts and results
3. **Reference materials** for understanding IRT methodology

## Integration with Documentation

These figures are referenced in the `docs/` directory for explanatory purposes. The documentation maintains symbolic links to these files to avoid duplication while ensuring figures are available for both technical reference and educational content.
