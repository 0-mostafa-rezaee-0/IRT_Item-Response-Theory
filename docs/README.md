# 1. High-level Concept

**What problem does IRT solve, and why was it invented?**
Item Response Theory (IRT) is a psychometric framework developed to overcome limitations of earlier **Classical Test Theory (CTT)** in measuring abilities and skills. Under CTT, a test-taker’s score is simply the total of correct answers, which makes comparisons difficult across different test forms or populations. IRT, by contrast, focuses on the **item level**: it models each question’s characteristics and the examinee’s ability on a common scale. This allows for *invariant measurement* – item difficulty can be assessed independently of who took the test, and an examinee’s ability can be estimated independently of the specific set of items they answered.

Historically, IRT emerged in the 1950s–60s from the work of psychometricians like Frederic Lord and Georg Rasch. It provided a more powerful alternative to CTT by recognizing that *not all items are equal* – some are harder, some discriminate better, etc. IRT was adopted for high-stakes exams (e.g. GRE, GMAT) because it yields more accurate and fair ability estimates. In summary, IRT was invented to create **adaptive, fair, and precise assessments** by modeling how individual test items function across different levels of student ability.

> **Side Note:** *CTT assumes each test-taker’s observed score = true score + error. IRT introduced item-specific parameters to overcome this, enabling more nuanced measurement and adaptive testing.*

---

# 2. Core Idea

**How does IRT model the relationship between a person’s ability and an item’s difficulty?**
Each person has a latent ability level (θ), and each item has parameters (difficulty, etc.). The probability of a correct response depends on both.

If an item is very easy *relative* to your ability, you’re likely to get it right; if it’s far above your ability, you’ll likely get it wrong. IRT captures this with an **Item Characteristic Curve (ICC)** – an S-shaped curve that plots the probability of a correct answer (y-axis) against ability θ (x-axis).

In the simplest case, an item’s **difficulty (b)** is the point where a test-taker has a 50% chance of answering correctly. Items and persons share the same latent scale: ability θ and difficulty b are directly comparable.

> **Side Note:**
>
> * **Latent Trait (θ):** Unobservable personal attribute (e.g., math proficiency).
> * **Item Difficulty (b):** Ability level with 50% chance of success.

---

# 3. Mathematical Essence (light)

**1PL, 2PL, 3PL Models (Conceptually)**
IRT models typically use logistic (S-shaped) functions to describe the probability that a person with ability θ answers item *i* correctly:

$$P(\text{correct}|\theta) = f(\theta, a_i, b_i, c_i)$$

## 3.1. 1PL (Rasch Model)

Only **difficulty (b)** varies between items. All items are equally discriminating, and guessing isn't modeled:

$$P_i(\text{correct}|\theta) = \frac{1}{1+\exp[-(\theta - b_i)]}$$

## 3.2. 2PL Model

Adds **discrimination (a)**, which controls slope steepness around difficulty point. Higher *a* → item better differentiates near its difficulty.

## 3.3. 3PL Model

Adds **guessing (c)**, a lower bound for the curve (e.g., 0.25 in 4-option MCQs):

$$P_i(\text{correct}|\theta) = c_i + (1-c_i)\frac{1}{1+\exp[-a_i(\theta - b_i)]}$$

In short:

* **1PL:** Difficulty shifts curve.
* **2PL:** Discrimination adjusts steepness.
* **3PL:** Guessing raises the lower floor.

# 4. Adaptive Testing Flow

**How IRT powers computer-based adaptive testing (CAT):**

1. **Initial ability estimate:** Start with θ = 0 (average ability).
2. **First item:** Pick a medium-difficulty item (b ≈ 0).
3. **Response:** User answers → correct/incorrect.
4. **Update ability:** Estimate θ using maximum likelihood or Bayesian methods.
5. **Select next item:** Choose item maximizing *information* near θ.
6. **Repeat:** Continue updating ability after each item.
7. **Stop:** When test precision meets target (or after fixed items).

**Scoring:** Final ability (θ̂) becomes the reported score, scaled (e.g. 200–800 for GMAT).

> **Side Note:** *CAT ensures efficient and precise measurement: fewer questions, tailored difficulty, and comparable scores across versions.*

# 5. Modern Extensions (AI-enhanced IRT)

## 5.1. Bayesian IRT

Adds priors and produces uncertainty estimates for θ and item parameters. Implemented via MCMC or variational Bayes (e.g., `brms`, `py-irt`).

## 5.2. Neural / Deep IRT

Uses neural networks to model complex item-person interactions. E.g., **Deep-IRT** combines RNN-based knowledge tracing with IRT for interpretability.

## 5.3. Reinforcement Learning (RL-CAT)

Frames test administration as sequential decision-making: select next item to maximize long-term information. RL learns dynamic policies beyond static IRT heuristics.

## 5.4. LLM-based Extensions

* **Item Generation:** Use LLMs to generate items of specific difficulty.
* **Response Simulation:** Use LLMs as synthetic test-takers to pre-calibrate item difficulty.
* **Difficulty Prediction:** Use embeddings of item text to predict difficulty and discrimination.

> **Goal:** Merge IRT’s interpretability with AI’s adaptivity — leading to next-generation adaptive systems.

# 6. Practical Examples

## 6.1. GRE (ETS)

Uses **multi-stage adaptive** testing: first section at medium level; second section difficulty chosen via IRT-based ability estimate.

## 6.2. PTE Academic

Fully adaptive. Uses IRT to continuously adjust question difficulty and compute scaled scores, ensuring precision and fairness.

## 6.3. GMAT (GMAC)

Fully item-level adaptive. Uses 3PL IRT; each response updates θ. "Which questions you get right" matters more than "how many."

> *IRT ensures different test-takers see unique but equivalent test experiences.*
